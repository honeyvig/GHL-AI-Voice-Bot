# GHL-AI-Voice-Bot
To set up an AI voice bot integrated with GoHighLevel (GHL), you’ll need to follow a series of steps to script and deploy the bot, allowing it to handle client calls, queries, and provide extensive responses. This integration involves utilizing AI voice technology (such as Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Twilio Autopilot) and ensuring it is seamlessly connected with GHL's features.

Below is an approach to creating a custom AI voice bot for your GHL account:
Key Steps:

    Create and Integrate a Voice AI Bot:
        Use a platform that supports voice synthesis and speech recognition (e.g., Twilio, Google Dialogflow, Amazon Lex).
        The voice bot will need the ability to engage with clients via text-to-speech and speech-to-text technology to recognize customer responses.

    Integrate the AI Voice Bot with GoHighLevel (GHL):
        Use GHL's API or webhooks to send data between GHL and the bot.
        Ensure that the bot can trigger actions within GHL such as logging calls, sending follow-up messages, and triggering workflows.

    Script Extensive Responses:
        Create conversational scripts for the bot to handle various use cases, including FAQ, appointment scheduling, customer inquiries, and product or service information.

Tools and Technologies:

    Twilio Autopilot or Dialogflow: To create the AI voice bot.
    GoHighLevel (GHL): For CRM and workflow automation.
    Text-to-Speech APIs (Google, AWS, or Twilio): To convert text to voice and vice versa.
    Webhooks: To trigger actions within GHL.
    Voice APIs: To make voice calls, process responses, and handle conversations.

Example Implementation:
Step 1: Setting up Google Dialogflow (or Twilio Autopilot)

For Google Dialogflow, you can create a virtual assistant capable of interacting with customers. Dialogflow provides both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities, so it can handle both customer input and provide appropriate voice-based responses.

Here’s how you could script the bot’s response logic using Dialogflow:

    Create Intent in Dialogflow:
        Intents are how Dialogflow understands what the user wants to do. You’ll need to create intents for different scenarios, such as greeting, FAQ, support, etc.

Example Intent:

{
  "intent": "Greeting",
  "trainingPhrases": [
    "Hello",
    "Hi",
    "Good morning"
  ],
  "responses": [
    "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "Hi there! What can I help you with today?"
  ]
}

    Fulfillment Logic:
        Use webhook fulfillment to trigger an action in your GHL account. For instance, after the user confirms their identity, the bot can create a contact or log the interaction in GHL.

import requests

def webhook(request):
    # Get the data from Dialogflow
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Extract user query or action
    query = data['queryResult']['queryText']
    
    # Example logic to trigger a workflow in GHL
    if 'appointment' in query.lower():
        payload = {
            "firstName": "John",
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "phone": "+1234567890",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com"
        }
        # Send this data to GHL via API or webhook to create a contact
        response = requests.post("https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts", json=payload)
    
    return {
        "fulfillmentText": "Your appointment has been scheduled."
    }

Step 2: Integrating with GoHighLevel

    Use GoHighLevel API or Webhooks: You can utilize GoHighLevel’s API to automate actions like creating a new contact, logging interactions, or triggering follow-up actions.

    Example API call to add a new contact:

    import requests

    def create_contact(first_name, last_name, phone, email):
        url = "https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts"
        headers = {
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
        data = {
            "firstName": first_name,
            "lastName": last_name,
            "phone": phone,
            "email": email
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()

    Handle Call Data with Twilio: If you're integrating Twilio for voice calls, you can use Twilio Autopilot to power the chatbot with voice capabilities. Autopilot helps to process both voice and text inputs.

Step 3: Implementing Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text

    Google Cloud Text-to-Speech can be used to convert the chatbot's responses into voice.
    Twilio's Voice API or Google Speech API can convert customer speech into text that the bot can understand.

Example of Text-to-Speech in Python using Google’s TTS API:

from google.cloud import texttospeech

def text_to_speech(text):
    client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()

    synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=text)
    voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
        language_code="en-US", ssml_gender=texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender.NEUTRAL
    )
    audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(
        audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3
    )

    response = client.synthesize_speech(
        input=synthesis_input, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config
    )

    # Save the response audio to a file
    with open("output.mp3", "wb") as out:
        out.write(response.audio_content)
    return "output.mp3"

Step 4: Script Extensive Responses and Scenarios

    Create Conversation Flows:
        Develop scenarios for the chatbot. These could be:
            Greeting
            Scheduling appointments
            Providing support for common queries (product/service information)
            Collecting feedback
            Handling common objections
            Providing updates on ongoing tasks

    Sample Response Script: Example of scripted interaction:

    {
      "intent": "Support",
      "trainingPhrases": [
        "I need help with my account",
        "Can you assist me with a problem?"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Of course! Please tell me your issue and I will try to help.",
        "I can help you with that. What seems to be the problem?"
      ]
    }

Step 5: Deploy and Test

    Deploy the Voice Bot:
        Once the bot is ready, integrate it with your GHL account using APIs or webhooks. Test the integration to ensure that the bot can create contacts, log interactions, and trigger workflows as expected.
    Test the Voice Interaction:
        Test the AI bot’s ability to handle voice interactions. Verify that it can recognize speech, respond appropriately, and handle tasks like scheduling or customer support.

Conclusion

The AI voice bot for GoHighLevel can be developed using Google Dialogflow or Twilio Autopilot for conversation handling, and integrated with GoHighLevel API to automate workflows such as creating contacts, sending follow-up emails, and triggering automations. You'll need to script the responses extensively based on customer queries and define the actions that the bot should take on behalf of the client.

By leveraging tools like Google TTS (Text-to-Speech) and Twilio for voice calls, you can create a comprehensive, fully-functional voice bot.
